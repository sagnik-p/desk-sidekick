This is basically a python based voice assistant.

Just keep it running in the background and let it do its magic.

NOTE: while the assistant is running, you wont be able to use your device microphone. To solve this issue, use an external mic or mic of earphones.


To get started,

1. install requirements by running the command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. run the main.py script
```
python main.py
```

Say "ZULU"
to activate the assistant.

I have named the Assistant "ZULU"
If you wish to call it something else, You will have to retrain the model.
ALL FILES ARE INCLUDED.
just run the following scripts in order and follow the on screen instructions:
1. RecordData.py
2. PreprocessingData.py
3. training.py

Features:
Short answer to queries, detailed answer to queries, time of any place, weather of any place, open system apps.
* currently, alarm mode is in text interactive mode only.
